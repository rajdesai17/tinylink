Take-Home Assignment: TinyLink
Build a small web app similar to bit.ly, where users can shorten URLs, view click statistics, and manage
links.
1. You may use Node.js + Express or Next.js — your choice.
2. Use any lightweight CSS (plain CSS or Tailwind).
3. Host it using free services such as Vercel, Render, or Railway, with a free database service such
as Neon (Postgres).
4. You can use AI as an assistant; but be prepared to understand and explain what it is doing.
Estimated time to complete: about 2 days.
Rules
- You can use ChatGPT, if you wish to. Still, you need to understand the design and implementation.
- Do not have others do the project for you. You will fail later anyways in the interview. Why put
ourselves through that trouble?
- We are going to use automated testing. So, it is imperative that you follow the URL conventions.
- Even if you cannot complete it, do as much as you can. You may get partial credit.
What you submit
1. We expect a public URL for testing.
2. We expect a github URL for reviewing the code.
3. We expect link to a video explaining your solution and walk us through the code
4. Link to ChatGPT transcript or any other LLM, if you took help from it
Core Features
The application will have a few pages and support a few APIs. Overall, here is the functionality it should
support:
Create short links
- Take a long URL and optionally a custom short code (e.g., docs →
https://example.com/docs) and create a redirection URL as <yourwebsite>/<shortcode>.
- Validate the URL before saving.
- Custom codes are globally unique across all users; if a code already exists, show an error.
Redirect
- Visiting /{code} performs an HTTP 302 redirect to the original URL.

- Each redirect increments the total-click count and updates the “last clicked” time.
Delete a link
- Users can delete existing links.
- After deletion, /{code} must return 404 and no longer redirect.
Main pages
Dashboard:
- Table of all links:
- Short code
- Target URL
- Total clicks
- Last clicked time
- Actions: Add and Delete [When adding sure to take custom code as an option]
- Optional search/filter by code or URL.
Stats page:
- Stats page /code/:code for viewing details of a single link.
Healthcheck:
- System details and uptime details
Interface & UX Expectations
Deliver a clean, thoughtful interface.
- Layout & Hierarchy: clear structure, readable typography, sensible spacing.
- States: show empty, loading, success, and error states.
- Form UX: inline validation, friendly error messages, disabled submit during loading, visible
confirmation on success.
- Tables: sort/filter, truncate long URLs with ellipsis, functional copy buttons.
- Consistency: shared header/footer, uniform button styles, consistent formatting.
- Responsiveness: layout adapts gracefully to narrow screens.
- Polish: minimal but complete; avoid raw unfinished HTML.
Pages & Routes
Purpose Path Auth
Dashboard (list, add, delete) / Public

Purpose Path Auth
Stats for a single code /code/:code Public
Redirect /:code Public
Health check /healthz Public

Hosting (Free Examples)
- Next.js on Vercel + Neon Postgres
- Node + Express on Render + Neon Postgres
- Node + Express on Railway + Postgres
Provide a .env.example listing required environment variables (e.g., database URL, base URL).
Autograding & Testability
To enable automated testing, please follow these conventions:
Stable URLs
- / — Dashboard
- /code/:code — Stats page
- /:code — Redirect (302 or 404)
Health Endpoint
- GET /healthz → returns status 200
Example response (feel free to add more):
{ "ok": true, "version": "1.0" }
API end points
Method Path
POST /api/links Create link (409 if code exists)
GET /api/links List all links
GET /api/links/:code Stats for one code
DELETE /api/links/:code Delete link
